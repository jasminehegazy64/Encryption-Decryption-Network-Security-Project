# Encryption-Decryption-Network-Security-Project
Course Project for Network security where we were introduced to ciphers and how to encrypt and decrypt using the following ciphers:
- Ceaser Cipher
- Hill Cipher
- PlayFair cipher
- Vignere Cipher
- Vernam Cipher
Added to a simple UI so that the users can add the ciphertext/plaintext and choose which cipher they want to be used.
